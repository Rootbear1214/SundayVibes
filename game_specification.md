# 2D Platformer Game Specification

## Project Overview
**Game Title:** SundayVibes Platformer  
**Genre:** 2D Side-scrolling Platformer  
**Platform:** Web Browser (HTML5/JavaScript)  
**Target System:** macOS (development)  

## Core Gameplay Requirements

### Player Movement
- **Movement Controls:**
  - `A` - Move Left
  - `D` - Move Right  
  - `S` - Crouch/Down (future use)
  - `W` - Jump
- **Movement Physics:**
  - Gravity-based jumping with arc trajectory
  - Ground friction and air resistance
  - Variable jump height based on key hold duration
  - Smooth acceleration/deceleration for horizontal movement

### Combat System
- **Attack Controls:**
  - `J` - Melee Punch Attack
  - `K` - Ranged Attack (projectile)
- **Combat Mechanics:**
  - Punch: Short-range, instant hit detection
  - Ranged: Projectile with travel time and gravity
  - Attack cooldowns to prevent spam
  - Hit feedback and damage system

### Camera System
- **Scrolling Behavior:**
  - Horizontal scrolling follows player movement
  - Camera leads slightly in movement direction
  - Smooth camera transitions (no jarring jumps)
  - Vertical scrolling for multi-level platforms
  - Camera bounds to prevent showing empty areas

## World Design

### Platform System
- **Platform Types:**
  - Solid ground platforms (full collision)
  - Jump-through platforms (one-way collision from below)
  - Moving platforms (horizontal/vertical patterns)
  - Breakable platforms (destroyed by attacks)
- **Platform Arrangements:**
  - Staggered height levels for jumping challenges
  - Gaps requiring precise jumps
  - Vertical climbing sections
  - Hidden/secret platform areas

### Level Structure
- **World Layout:**
  - Side-scrolling linear progression
  - Multiple vertical layers (ground, mid-air, high platforms)
  - Interconnected platform networks
  - Environmental obstacles and hazards

## Technical Specifications

### Graphics Requirements
- **Visual Style:**
  - Simple 2D geometric shapes
  - Solid color fills (no textures initially)
  - Clear visual distinction between interactive elements
- **Player Character:**
  - Rectangle or circle shape
  - Distinct color (e.g., blue or green)
  - Simple animation states (idle, walking, jumping, attacking)
- **Platforms:**
  - Rectangular shapes with solid borders
  - Different colors for different platform types
  - Visual feedback for interactive elements
- **Projectiles:**
  - Small circular or square shapes
  - Contrasting color for visibility
  - Simple trail effect (optional)

### Performance Requirements
- **Frame Rate:** 60 FPS target
- **Resolution:** Scalable to browser window
- **Optimization:** Efficient collision detection and rendering
